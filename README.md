# Kong-Ingress-Controller-
Use of this operator for new Kong installations is discouraged in favor of the kubectl and Helm installation methods. This operator is being deprecated in favor of a replacement based on Golang (instead of Helm). During the version v0.x.x lifecycle of this tool we decided that Helm did not suite our needs for a robust feature-rich operator. Security updates for this repository will be continued for the time being; but new features and other requests will not be prioritized. You can track the progress of the successor operator here and we highly encourage feature requests and discussions on the new operator repository to let us know your use cases and needs.
